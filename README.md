Sudoku Solver

This Python program solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

Requirements: 
Python 3.x
***
Usage
1.Clone the repository or download the Python script (sudoku_solver.py) directly.
2.Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.Navigate to the directory containing sudoku_solver.py.
4.Run the script using Python: python sudoku_solver.py
5.The program will output the solved Sudoku puzzle.

Sudoku Puzzle Input
Modify the puzzle variable in the script to input your Sudoku puzzle. Use a 9x9 grid, where empty cells are represented by 0.

Example puzzle format:

puzzle = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]
***
Algorithm

The program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It checks each cell in the grid and tries possible numbers until a valid solution is found.
